# Accelerating-MST-Construction-with-Parallel-Algorithms
Implement and compare the performance of parallel versions of Prim’s, Kruskal’s, and Boruvka’s algorithms. Demonstrate the efficiency gains achieved through the use of advanced data structures and parallel processing techniques and Analyze the suitability of each algorithm for different types of graph structures and sizes.
